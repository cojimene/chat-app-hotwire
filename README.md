# README

Welcome, this is just a sample application as a result of taking the course "Ruby on Rails and Hotwire - 2023" in Udemy. The code differs by far from the code showed in the course, because I removed the model callbacks and made another improvements and refactoring in the files and architecture. So, this is my own version.

* Ruby version: 3.0.4
  
* Rails Version: 7.0.8.5

* System dependencies: PostgreSQL

* Configuration: Clone the repository in you machine, install PostgreSQL and start the deamon, install ruby 3.0.4 and run:
    - `bundle install`
    - `rails db:create`
    - `rails db:migrate`
    - `bin/dev` => to launch foreman, but if you are not going to change the code just run `rails server`
      
  Finally go to your browser and open localhost:3000
